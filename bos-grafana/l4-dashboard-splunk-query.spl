# L4 Product Lines Dashboard - Splunk Query
# ============================================
# This SPL query replaces the SQL query in the L4 minimalist dashboard
# for use with Splunk datasource in Grafana.
#
# IMPORTANT: Lookup table names use 'bos_' prefix
# - bos_services.csv
# - bos_signal_status.csv
# - bos_incidents.csv
#
# If your Splunk lookup tables use different names, update lines 13, 16, and 38.

# ============================================
# Expected Output Fields
# ============================================
# l4_product_line     - Product line name (string)
# service_count       - Total services (number)
# services_with_signals - Services with health signals (number)
# coverage            - % with signals, rounded to 1 decimal (number)
# health              - Average health score, rounded to 1 decimal (number)
# health_status       - Green/Amber/Red (string)
# incident_count      - Open Sev1/Sev2 incidents (number)
#
# Expected output: 4 rows (Auto Lending, Credit Cards, Home Lending, Personal Loans)
#
# ============================================
# Testing in Splunk
# ============================================
# Before using in Grafana, test this query in Splunk Search:
# 1. Copy entire query (lines 13-47)
# 2. Paste into Splunk Search
# 3. Verify 4 rows appear with correct data
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - No results? Check lookup tables exist: | inputlookup bos_services.csv | head 5
# - Wrong data? Verify field names are case-sensitive and match CSV headers exactly
# - Join failures? Ensure service_id field exists in all 3 CSVs

# ============================================
# DIAGNOSTIC QUERY - Test Home Lending per-service health
# ============================================
# Use this query to verify per-service health calculations before testing full query
# Expected results for Home Lending:
# SVC001: service_health=72.2, signal_count=3 (Green/Amber/Red signals)
# SVC002: service_health=75.0, signal_count=3
# SVC003: service_health=90.0, signal_count=2
# SVC004/SVC017/SVC020: service_health=null, signal_count=0
#
# Then avg(72.2, 75.0, 90.0) should equal 79.1%
