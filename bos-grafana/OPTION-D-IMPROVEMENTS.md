# Option D: Improved Gap and Approach Sections

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Ready for review
**File:** `landing-screen-readability-option-D.html`

## Summary

Option D incorporates three critical improvements based on Wells Fargo operational reality:

1. **Hour+ investigation time** (not 15 minutes) - accurate pain point
2. **Cross-functional team assembly** (support + dev + product SMEs) - shows coordination overhead
3. **Standardization benefit** - addresses dashboard fragmentation across 1000s of services

## Gap Section Improvements

### What Changed

**Before (Option A):**
```
15-minute investigation begins. Our first responders manually calculate
business impact while the incident continues.

Every incident requires this manual investigation.
```

**After (Option D):**
```
Without business impact instrumentation, we assemble a cross-functional team -
support, development, and product SMEs - who spend the next hour+ manually
calculating these answers. The incident continues. The questions remain unanswered.

This investigation repeats every incident - unless business impact is already
pre-instrumented.
```

### Why This Is Stronger

1. **"hour+" vs "15 minutes"**
   - Accurate to Wells Fargo reality (user feedback)
   - Emphasizes real operational cost

2. **"cross-functional team - support, development, and product SMEs"**
   - Shows coordination overhead (not just incident response)
   - All three senior leader audiences see themselves
   - Emphasizes expertise requirement (even SMEs need hour+)
   - Shows interruption cost (pulled from other work)

3. **"The incident continues. The questions remain unanswered."**
   - Parallel structure emphasizes dual failure
   - More visceral than "while the incident continues"

4. **"unless business impact is already pre-instrumented"**
   - Acknowledges 5% edge case (teams who already solved this)
   - Maintains accuracy without weakening message
   - Positions BOS as the solution the 5% discovered

## Approach Section Improvements

### What Changed

**Before (Option A):**
```
Product requirements capture functional specifications. Business requirements -
stakeholder expectations, compliance deadlines, operational efficiency targets -
often remain implicit.

BOS makes these implicit business requirements explicit, measurable, and
operationally actionable.
```

**After (Option D):**
```
Why does this investigation keep happening?

We instrument what we build (APIs, databases, queues) but typically not what
stakeholders expect (outcomes, timelines, business impact).

And each team builds their own dashboards - no standard approach, no way to
navigate across 1000s of services.

BOS provides a standard pattern: business expectations become as measurable,
visible, and discoverable as technical health.
```

### Why This Is Stronger

1. **Question format: "Why does this investigation keep happening?"**
   - Bridges directly from Gap section
   - More engaging than statement
   - Focuses on root cause

2. **"what we build vs. what stakeholders expect"**
   - Clearer than "implicit/explicit"
   - Dev leaders: "Yes, I instrument what I build"
   - Product leaders: "Yes, stakeholders have expectations"
   - More concrete distinction

3. **"typically not"**
   - Accurate (5% do, 95% don't)
   - Avoids overstatement

4. **NEW: Standardization benefit**
   - "each team builds their own dashboards"
   - "no standard approach, no way to navigate across 1000s of services"
   - Addresses second strategic pain point (fragmentation)
   - Positions BOS as enterprise platform, not service-specific tool

5. **"discoverable"**
   - Explicitly addresses navigation problem
   - Complements "measurable" and "visible"

## Audience Impact

### Product Leaders
- **Gap**: "Yes, we get pulled into SEV1 calls to calculate customer impact"
- **Approach**: "Yes, stakeholder expectations aren't instrumented" + "Yes, no standard navigation"

### Development Leaders
- **Gap**: "Yes, my SMEs spend hours investigating" + "Yes, they're pulled from sprint work"
- **Approach**: "Yes, I instrument technical systems but not business outcomes"

### Platform Operations Leaders
- **Gap**: "Yes, I coordinate this cross-functional fire drill every incident"
- **Approach**: "Yes, dashboard fragmentation is chaos" + "Yes, need standard pattern"

## Communication Structure

```
Gap Section:
├─ Concrete operational pain (hour+ cross-functional investigation)
├─ Dual failure (incident continues + questions unanswered)
├─ Systemic pattern (repeats every incident)
└─ Accurate scope (unless already pre-instrumented)

Approach Section:
├─ Root cause question (why does this happen?)
├─ Instrumentation gap (technical vs business)
├─ Fragmentation gap (no standard, no navigation)
└─ Strategic capability (standard pattern + discoverability)
```

**Flow:** Concrete urgent pain → Root cause analysis → Strategic capability

## Comparison to Other Options

| Aspect | Option A | Option D |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Investigation time | 15 minutes | hour+ ✅ |
| Responders | "first responders" | "cross-functional team - support, dev, product SMEs" ✅ |
| Audience recognition | Operations focus | All three audiences ✅ |
| Accuracy | Strong language | Precise + strong ✅ |
| Standardization | Not mentioned | Explicitly addressed ✅ |
| Approach format | Statements | Question + answer ✅ |
| Clarity | "implicit/explicit" | "what we build vs what stakeholders expect" ✅ |

## Next Steps

1. **Review Option D** in browser alongside Option A
2. **Get user approval** for improvements
3. **Integrate** into main files:
   - `landing-screen-executive-streamlined.html`
   - `option5-bos-onboarding-complete.html`
4. **Commit and push** to both repos (bos-artifacts, bos-excel)

## Key Takeaways

**Option D is superior because:**
- ✅ Accurate to Wells Fargo reality (hour+, cross-functional, 1000s of services)
- ✅ All three senior leader audiences recognize themselves
- ✅ Addresses two strategic pain points (investigation + fragmentation)
- ✅ Maintains strength without overstatement
- ✅ Better communication structure (question format, clearer distinctions)
