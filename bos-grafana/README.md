## Data Source

Generic banking industry services synthesized from publicly available information. Educational/demonstration use only.

**⚠️ Limited Sample Data**: Only 3 services (SVC001, SVC002, SVC003) have signals, all in **Home Lending** L4 product line. Other product lines will show 0% coverage. See `SPLUNK-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for testing guidance.

## Usage

Import into Grafana datasources (SQLite, Splunk lookups, etc.) for BOS dashboard development.

### SQLite Example

```bash
# Convert CSVs to SQLite database
python3 csv_to_sqlite.py

# Use with Grafana SQLite datasource
```

### Splunk Lookup Tables

**Setup:**
1. Upload CSVs to Splunk: Settings → Lookups → Lookup table files → Add new
   - Upload as: `bos_services.csv`, `bos_signal_status.csv`, `bos_incidents.csv`
   - Or rename lookups after upload
2. Create lookup definitions for each CSV file
3. Test: `| inputlookup bos_services.csv | head 5`

**L4 Dashboard Query:**

Use the complete SPL query in `l4-dashboard-splunk-query.spl` for the L4 Product Lines dashboard.

**Key points:**
- Query expects lookup tables prefixed with `bos_` (e.g., `bos_services.csv`)
- Modify lines 13, 16, 38 if using different names
- Test in Splunk Search before using in Grafana
- Returns 4 rows: Auto Lending, Credit Cards, Home Lending, Personal Loans

**L3 Dashboard Query:**

Use the complete SPL query in `l3-dashboard-splunk-query.spl` for the L3 Products dashboard.

**Key points:**
- Query expects lookup tables prefixed with `bos_` (e.g., `bos_services.csv`)
- Filters by L4 Product Line using dashboard variable `$l4_product_line$`
- Includes business_purpose field (l3_description from services.csv)
- Test in Splunk Search before using in Grafana (replace variable with actual value)
- Returns variable rows depending on L4 Product Line selected

**Grafana Integration:**
1. Replace SQL query in dashboard JSON with SPL query
2. Change datasource type to `grafana-splunk-datasource`
3. Update datasource UID to your Splunk datasource
4. Use Splunk v5.6.1 format: `query` field with `rawQuery: true` (NOT `queryText` or `format`)

**⚠️ Important for SQL → SPL Translation:**

If translating additional SQL queries to SPL, **read `SPLUNK-SQL-TRANSLATION-LESSONS.md` first**.

Key insights:
- Splunk `join` is 1-to-1 (not 1-to-many like SQL LEFT JOIN) - use `lookup` instead
- Multi-level aggregations require multiple `stats` commands
- Always handle null values explicitly (coalesce, fillnull)
- Multi-value fields need mvindex() extraction

These lessons prevent hours of debugging!

## Grafana Dashboard Deployment (Grafana v11+)

- **Signals** (how we measure health)
- **Incidents** (what goes wrong)

This enables correlation of technical metrics with business impact.
