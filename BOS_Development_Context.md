# BOS Excel Development Context - Session Handoff

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Excel-based Business Observability System prototype for management demonstration
**Approach**: Transform 52-field complex data model into guided, persona-driven Excel interface
**Status**: v3.4 - Stable professional prototype with corrected field ownership

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Data Model (5 Normalized Tables)
1. **Services** (10 fields) - Master service definitions [Product Owner owned]
2. **SLI_Definitions** (16 fields) - Technical measurements [Mixed PO/Dev ownership]
3. **SLO_Configurations** (9 fields) - Performance targets [Mixed PO/Ops ownership]
4. **Impact_Assessments** (12 fields) - Business impact scenarios [Mixed PO/Dev ownership]
5. **Operational_Metadata** (13 fields) - Deployment/lifecycle data [Operations owned]

### Persona Field Ownership (CORRECTED in v3.1)
- **Product Owner**: 22 fields - Business context, success definitions, impact descriptions
- **Developer**: 15 fields - Technical implementation, queries, measurement logic
- **Operations**: 18 fields - Deployment config, alerting, lifecycle management

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Service-centric design**: All tables link via service_id foreign key
- **Display name abstraction**: Users see "Treasury Order Funding Service", system uses "SVC001"
- **Dynamic lookup formulas**: INDEX/MATCH patterns with IFERROR error handling
- **Persona separation**: Forms organized by accountability, not technical structure

## Current Sample Data
**SVC001 - Treasury Order Funding Service**
- Business Purpose: Execute wire transfers to complete home purchase transactions
- Performance Question: What percentage of wire transfers complete successfully on scheduled closing date?
- Impact: 850 daily homebuyers affected, $380K average loss per delay
- Technical: funding-success-rate SLI, 99.5% target, SQL data source

**SVC002 - Credit Check Service** 
- Business Purpose: Validate borrower creditworthiness for loan approval decisions
- Performance Question: What percentage of credit checks return valid scores within acceptable time?
- Impact: 2000 daily applicants, regulatory compliance risk (FCRA 30-day requirement)
- Technical: credit-check-success-rate SLI, 99.5% target, SQL data source

## Version History & Critical Fixes

### v1.0 - Basic Structure
- Initial 5-table normalized design
- Basic entry forms
- Simple dashboard

### v2.0 - Dynamic Service Selection
- Service dropdown using display names
- INDEX/MATCH lookup formulas
- Cross-sheet data relationships

### v3.0 - Field Ownership Corrections
**CRITICAL**: Corrected persona field assignments based on CSV documentation
- Moved sliType from PO → Dev form
- Moved 6 SLO operational fields from Dev → Ops form
- Moved 4 impact query fields from PO → Dev form
- Updated Service_Data_Model color coding

### v3.1 - Formula Reference Fix  
**CRITICAL**: Fixed Service_Data_Model #N/A errors
- All PO field formulas corrected to use D3 helper cell instead of B3
- Resolved circular reference issues

### v3.2 - Enhanced Professional Styling
- Professional color palette (navy/green/red theme)
- Enhanced stats boxes with better visual hierarchy
- Improved typography and spacing
- Professional section headers

### v3.3 - Conditional Formatting (FAILED)
- Attempted dynamic status color coding
- Caused Excel file corruption

### v3.4 - Stable Professional Edition (CURRENT)
- Removed problematic conditional formatting
- Maintained all visual improvements
- File opens cleanly without recovery warnings
- Production-ready for management demo

## Critical Success Factors

### What Works Well
1. **Service dropdown abstraction** - Users never see technical service_ids
2. **Dynamic data population** - All sheets update when service selection changes  
3. **Error handling** - IFERROR functions prevent #N/A displays
4. **Visual hierarchy** - Professional appearance suitable for management
5. **Persona organization** - Clear field accountability by role

### Known Limitations
1. **Entry forms are static** - Don't dynamically populate with existing data for editing
2. **Single impact assessment** - Only shows first impact row per service  
3. **No data validation** - Users can enter invalid values
4. **No save/load workflow** - Changes made in forms don't persist to data tables
5. **Manual service_id management** - No auto-generation of new service IDs

### Proven Technical Patterns
```excel
# Service lookup pattern (WORKS)
=INDEX(Services!B:B,MATCH(A1,Services!A:A,0))

# Error handling pattern (WORKS) 
=IFERROR(INDEX(Services!B:B,MATCH(A1,Services!A:A,0)), "Not Defined")

# Helper cell pattern for service selection (WORKS)
A1: =INDEX(Services!A:A,MATCH(B3,Services!C:C,0))  # Convert display name → service_id
```

## Future Development Guidelines

### Adding New Services
1. Add row to Services table with new service_id (SVC###)
2. Add corresponding rows to other 4 tables with same service_id
3. Update dropdown ranges if needed (Services!C2:C10)

### Modifying Field Ownership
1. Check CSV documentation for authoritative persona ownership
2. Update entry form field lists
3. Update Service_Data_Model persona sections
4. Update field count headers
5. Maintain color coding (green=PO, blue=Dev, gray=Ops)

### Dashboard Enhancement Patterns
- Use IFERROR for all lookup formulas
- Maintain helper cell pattern (A1 = service_id)
- Test with both SVC001 and SVC002 
- Avoid conditional formatting (causes file corruption)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] File opens without Excel recovery warnings
- [ ] Service dropdown shows display names
- [ ] Switching services updates all dynamic fields
- [ ] No #N/A errors visible to users
- [ ] Professional appearance maintained
- [ ] All persona forms show correct field counts

## Immediate Next Session Starter
```
"I'm continuing development of the BOS Excel prototype. Current version is v3.4 - a stable professional prototype with 53 fields across 3 personas. 

The build script is build_bos_excel_v3.4.py. Current sample data covers SVC001 (treasury funding) and SVC002 (credit checks).

New requirements: [SPECIFY NEW REQUIREMENTS]

Please analyze the current architecture and implement the requested changes while maintaining the established patterns and professional appearance."
```

## Critical Decisions Made
1. **Field ownership corrections**: Based on CSV documentation analysis, not assumptions
2. **Professional styling approach**: Static styling over dynamic conditional formatting
3. **Error handling strategy**: IFERROR wrappers to prevent #N/A displays
4. **Service abstraction**: Display names for users, service_id for system
5. **Persona separation**: Forms by accountability, not technical convenience

## Architecture Constraints
- **Excel limitations**: No real database, file-based prototype only
- **Formula complexity**: INDEX/MATCH patterns proven reliable
- **Visual styling**: Static approaches more stable than dynamic
- **Data relationships**: Foreign key simulation via lookup formulas
- **User experience**: Balance between functionality and Excel constraints

## Success Metrics
- File opens cleanly without warnings
- Professional appearance suitable for management demo
- All persona field counts accurate (22 PO, 15 Dev, 18 Ops)
- Dynamic service selection works consistently
- Error-free data display across all services
