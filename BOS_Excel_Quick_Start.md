# BOS Excel Quick Start Guide - Next Session

## Immediate Handoff Status
**Current Version**: v3.4 - Stable Professional Prototype  
**Status**: Production-ready for management demo, tested and verified  
**Build Script**: `build_bos_excel_v3.4.py` (complete standalone version)

## Quick Session Startup
```bash
# 1. Run the current build script
python3 build_bos_excel_v3.4.py
# Outputs: BOS_Dashboard_Prototype_v3.4.xlsx

# 2. For new requirements, modify the script and increment version
# 3. Always test with both SVC001 and SVC002 before delivery
```

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ **5-table normalized data model** with proper relationships
- ✅ **3 persona-specific entry forms** (22 PO + 15 Dev + 18 Ops fields)
- ✅ **Dynamic dashboard** with service selection and professional styling
- ✅ **Complete service data model view** with all 53 fields
- ✅ **Error handling** throughout (no #N/A displays)
- ✅ **Professional appearance** suitable for executive presentation

## Architecture At-A-Glance
```
Data Layer: 5 CSV-equivalent tables in Excel
Logic Layer: INDEX/MATCH formulas with IFERROR handling
UI Layer: Forms (data entry) + Dashboard (visualization) + Model (complete view)
```

## Known Working Patterns
1. **Service Selection**: Display names → Service IDs via helper cells
2. **Dynamic Population**: INDEX/MATCH with service_id lookup
3. **Error Handling**: IFERROR wrapper for all lookups
4. **Professional Styling**: Static colors/fonts (no conditional formatting)

## Common Next Requirements & Solutions

### "Make entry forms editable/dynamic"
**Solution Pattern**: Add service selection dropdowns to forms + populate fields with INDEX/MATCH lookups + add save functionality

### "Add more services"  
**Solution Pattern**: Extend data arrays in script with new SVC### entries + update dropdown ranges

### "Enhance dashboard visualizations"
**Solution Pattern**: Add charts using Excel chart objects + trend data arrays + comparative views

### "Add data validation"
**Solution Pattern**: Add DataValidation objects for dropdowns + format validation for dates/emails

### "Export to monitoring systems"
**Solution Pattern**: Add JSON/CSV export functions + API integration sheets

## Critical Constraints
- **No conditional formatting** (causes file corruption)
- **Test both SVC001/SVC002** before delivery
- **Maintain persona field ownership** per documentation
- **Use IFERROR for all lookups** to prevent errors
- **Keep professional styling** for management readiness

## Development Speed Tips
- **Copy existing formula patterns** rather than creating new ones
- **Use find/replace** to update service references quickly  
- **Test incrementally** - one change at a time
- **Save working versions** before major changes

## Emergency Recovery
If new version breaks:
1. **Revert to v3.4 build script** (known working)
2. **Identify specific change** that caused issues
3. **Apply change incrementally** with testing
4. **Check Excel error log** for specific failures

## File Verification Checklist
Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] File opens without recovery warnings
- [ ] Service dropdown works (shows display names)
- [ ] Switching services updates all fields
- [ ] No #N/A errors visible
- [ ] Professional appearance maintained
- [ ] Field counts correct (22/15/18)

## Next Session Context Template
```
"Continuing BOS Excel development from v3.4 stable base.
